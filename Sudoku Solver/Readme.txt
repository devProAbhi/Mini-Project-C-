Sudoku Solver
A simple sudoku solver in C++ Project.
C++ program that takes an incomplete sudoku grid and returns one correct solution.
You can use the code and try it with other Sudoku grid.
All necessary explanation can be found in presentation.pptx and you can also understand the algorithm by the comments written in the code.

How to Use
A) In the Code there is a Grid matrix, So without input we can directly run the program and will get a solved sudoko.

B) You can also run this code for any other unsolved sudoku.
   1) Firstly, remove the comments which closed our "cin" function. 
   2) Enter input of the sudoku puzzle you want to solve and run the program.For the empty spaces of the sudoku puzzle you       can assign 0. You will get solved puzzle.
   3) You can also copy grid matrix which is seperated by space and paste it in input. You will get solved puzzle.

For example, a completely blank puzzle and a normal puzzle would like like:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
